Wikipedia is one of the most popular websites for collecting information. However, is it a reliable source for business research? Here I will try to go over the Pros and Cons of using Wikipedia for business research, and what you should to keep in mind when using it.

### Pros of Using Wikipedia for Business Research:

1. Consensus viewpoint: Wikipedia is an excellent source to get a consensus viewpoint on a subject (Caufield, n.d.). The articles are often the best available introduction to a topic, because of the strict rules about sourcing facts to reliable sources and the requirement for authors to adopt a neutral point of view (Caufield, n.d.).
2. Reliable sources: A particular advantage of Wikipedia is that it pays special attention to the sources of all statements (Caufield, n.d.). If you find a claim in a Wikipedia article, you can almost always follow the footnote on the claim to a reliable source (Caufield, n.d.). This makes it easier for business research to find authoritative sources for claims.

### Cons of using Wikipedia for business research:

1. Caution is required: Wikipedia is a great source for information but itâ€™s important to use it with caution, particularly when writing about controversial topics or developing events. (Caufield, n.d.).
2. Not always up-to-date: Wikipedia is written and edited by volunteers, and not all articles are updated regularly. This means that some information may be outdated, so it's important to double-check everything.

In conclusion, using Wikipedia as a starting point for business research can be quite helpful, but you should always use caution and double-check the material you find. Starting with Wikipedia's resources and summaries can help you get a good understanding of a subject (Caufield, n.d.), but it's always advisable to double-check the material with other reliable sources.
